## My Most Verbose Backgrounds

When I was a child, I have always been keen on going to live classical music concerts, especially the ones performed by symphony orchestras.
The cities I have spent the most time are all small cities (Hefei, Huainan and Adelaide).
There hasn't been much opportunities for a proper-sized or decent such concerts.

I moved to Sydney in 2019 due to work, but it was soon followed by the notorious 3-year COVID-19.
I haven't experienced much in Sydney (and I also didn't write much as you might have noticed).
Since last year, lots of famous artists announced their world tours, and most of them announced Sydney which made me really excited.
Early this year, I went to the Jay Chou's live concert. It was really enjoyable to finally see the artist who I followed since primary school,
especially that I have listened to all Jay Chou's songs for uncountable times during COVID.
This was also my first time being to live concert, which was really exciting.
However noteably, I failed to secure a ticket for Taylor Swift's Era Tour. üò≠üò≠

On my bucket list, I'm still keeping eyes on Joe Hisaishi and Hans Zimmer's original soundtrack concerts.
I find that lots of orchestras like to use their names in the performance names because they are playing their pieces.
As you might guess, what I am really looking for was kinda like a comfort from paying back to my childhood stars whose works have influenced my whole life.

A few months back, I went to a live orchestra concert called _Candlelight: Best of Joe Hisaishi_ at the Sydney Town Hall.
Candlelight was actually a pretty famous symphony orchestra.
No wonder this became my first time attending a live (maybe) contemporary music concert. 
That was my first time realizing they actually didn't need any speakers or any artificial amplifiers. 
The experience was superb, and OMG I started liking Sydney.
Below was the live photo taken during the initial preparation ~~last piece - _Departures_ (from Movie _Departures_ 2008)~~ at Tier 2 seat:

## Knowing Hayato Sumino (ËßíÈáé ÈöºÊñó / Cateen / „Åã„Å¶„ÅÉ„Çì)

I didn't know Hayato Sumino until one day YouTube fed me a video from him early this year.




bought tickets on Sept 5

## Before the Recital

Two days ago (Nov 5, 2023), Hayato Sumino had his first concert in Australia.

## After and After-Story


Speaking of audiences (comparing betwene candlelight, Yundi Li's)
etiquette

Speaking of the pricing


Speaking of the location

Speaking of the organizer

comparisons with other recitals from the same organizer

Concerto ÂçèÂ•èÊõ≤

Sonata Â•èÈ∏£Êõ≤


After looking at the organizer - Harmonie International's [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@harmonietube),
I realized the composer of _River Flows in You_ - Yiruma (Ïù¥Î£®Îßà / ÊùéÈñèÁèâ / ÊùéÈó∞Áèâ) also would have a live recital in the Sydney Opera House on Dec 3rd this year (i.e. next month).
Honestly speaking, I didn't recognize his English name initially.
I quickly went to the official website trying to get a ticket or two, but none was left.
Thinking of Yundi Li's ticketing experience, I might still be lucky to get tickets when the performance is approaching.
I'll make sure to refresh the website multiple times a day to make sure I won't miss that.

Note that initially I thought Yiruma was the reason I joined [Jpopsuki](https://web.archive.org/web/20231102202218/https://wiki.installgentoo.com/index.php/Private_trackers)
when I was looking for a complete lossless album containing _River Flows in You_.
Then, I realized the album covers didn't match my memory.

After further searches and recalls, I found it was from _July (Ï§ÑÎùºÏù¥) - Beyond the Memory_.
Here's the cover of the first album I downloaded from PT world (I should probably write another post about it üëª):
