## My Most Verbose Backgrounds

When I was a child, I have always been keen on going to live classical music concerts, especially the ones performed by symphony orchestras.
The cities I have spent the most time are all small cities (Hefei, Huainan and Adelaide).
There hasn't been much opportunities for a proper-sized or decent such concerts.

I moved to Sydney in 2019 due to work, but it was soon followed by the notorious 3-year COVID-19.
I haven't experienced much in Sydney (and I also didn't write much as you might have noticed).
Since last year, lots of famous artists announced their world tours, and most of them announced Sydney which made me really excited.
Early this year, I went to the Jay Chou's live concert. It was really enjoyable to finally see the artist who I followed since primary school,
especially that I have listened to all Jay Chou's songs for uncountable times during COVID.
This was also my first time being to live concert, which was really exciting.
However notably, I failed to secure a ticket for Taylor Swift's Era Tour. üò≠üò≠

On my bucket list, I'm still keeping eyes on Joe Hisaishi and Hans Zimmer's original soundtrack concerts.
I find that lots of orchestras like to use their names in the performance names because they are playing their pieces.
As you might guess, what I am really looking for was kinda like a comfort from paying back to my childhood stars whose works have influenced my whole life.

A few months back, I went to a live orchestra concert called _Candlelight: Best of Joe Hisaishi_ at the Sydney Town Hall.
Candlelight was actually a pretty famous symphony orchestra.
No wonder this became my first time attending a live (maybe) contemporary music concert. 
That was my first time realizing they actually didn't need any speakers or any artificial amplifiers. 
The experience was superb, and OMG I started liking Sydney.
Below was the live photo taken during the initial preparation ~~last piece - _Departures_ (from Movie _Departures_ 2008)~~ at Tier 2 seat:

## Knowing Hayato Sumino (ËßíÈáé ÈöºÊñó / Cateen / „Åã„Å¶„ÅÉ„Çì)

Interestingly at the very beginning, I didn't know Hayato Sumino at all, until one day (early this year) YouTube started feeding me the same video from him repetitively.
That video also instantly drew my attention which I couldn't ignore.
I couldn't recall which video it was. It might be [Suzume (Piano Ver.)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlELy-EVLNw).

_Suzume_ was a movie from Makoto Shinkai released on April 13th in Australia this year.
I was a big fan of _Your Name._ (which I probably haven't mentioned that I watched this anime for 20+ times),
so I have already watched the first day's session before seeing that video.
Plus, that video has a really nice edit that shows two words inside and outside the piano.

After watching that video, I started watching more fed videos from him.
His videos always shows great happiness and passions when he plays the piano.
It is really satisfying watching as an audience.
Apart from that, I also quite like his logo and net name - Cateen because I'm a big fan of cat as well.
My net name - MewX is actually from `Cat + X`.

I also found that he studied IT in Tokyo University.
It was the same industry with me, so I thought that was really impressive to have such great skill in piano performance.

When I accidentally heard he was going to Sydney, it was already Sept 5.
The ticket was on public sale a month before that day, and the early bird sale had ended.
The good seats were all taken, and I really didn't want to seat at the back if possible based on my experience for the Candlelight concert (same venue).
After a few refreshes, I saw there were exactly two SVIP (highest tier) tickets left.


From the [Eventbrite website](https://web.archive.org/web/20231016044305/https://www.eventbrite.com.au/e/2023-hayato-sumino-piano-recital-in-sydney-tickets-680599931717),
here are the differences between the two types of VIP tickets:

> - SVIP Tickets include a group photo with Mr Hayato
> - EACH VIP Ticket includes an autographed merchandise

and the ticket prices are (when I purchased):
- SVIP: A$209.29
- VIP: ~A$176 (couldn't find any references)
- Tier 1: A$146.51
- Tier 2: A$115.13
- Tier 3: A$83.74
- Tier 4: A$56.64
- Disabled: A$62.82

I'm okay with VIP tickets. However, there's not much good spots left.
Since it's my first time, I decided to get the best seat. So, SVIP it is! üòÅ
I had to say the SVIP tier ticket was higher than most top tier concert tickets.

_Turned out that the `group photo` above was actually `individual photo`! Definitely worthed the price!_

After buying the ticket, I also noticed Yundi Li would perform in the Sydney Opera House.
I was kinda tempted to buy tickets for that as well because I had never been seated in the Opera House yet. üòÇ
However, I ended up thinking twice because I'm not really a big fan of Yundi tbh.

## Before the Recital

Two days ago (Nov 5, 2023), Hayato Sumino had his first concert in Australia.

## After and After-Story


Speaking of audiences (comparing betwene candlelight, Yundi Li's)
etiquette

Speaking of the pricing


Speaking of the location

Speaking of the organizer

comparisons with other recitals from the same organizer



TODO: add swag pictures (without Geo location)

Concerto ÂçèÂ•èÊõ≤

Sonata Â•èÈ∏£Êõ≤


After looking at the organizer - Harmonie International's [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@harmonietube),
I realized the composer of _River Flows in You_ - Yiruma (Ïù¥Î£®Îßà / ÊùéÈñèÁèâ / ÊùéÈó∞Áèâ) also would have a live recital in the Sydney Opera House on Dec 3rd this year (i.e. next month).
Honestly speaking, I didn't recognize his English name initially.
I quickly went to the official website trying to get a ticket or two, but none was left.
Thinking of Yundi Li's ticketing experience, I might still be lucky to get tickets when the performance is approaching.
I'll make sure to refresh the website multiple times a day to make sure I won't miss that.

Note that initially I thought Yiruma was the reason I joined [Jpopsuki](https://web.archive.org/web/20231102202218/https://wiki.installgentoo.com/index.php/Private_trackers)
when I was looking for a complete lossless album containing _River Flows in You_.
Then, I realized the album covers didn't match my memory.

<center><img src="{{ site.cdn }}imgs/202311/yiruma-best-of-album-cover.jpg" style="max-width:50%;"/></center>

After further searches and recalls, I found it was from _July (Ï§ÑÎùºÏù¥) - Beyond the Memory_.
Here's the cover of the first album I downloaded from PT world (I should probably write another post about it üëª):
